Action: Sorts an array of elements in ascending order
Input: Array of elements (data) to be sorted
Output: Algorithm sorts array but no value is returned


If data is null:
    throw new Illegal Argument Exception (cannot sort a null array)

for each slot in data (i) as far as data.length-1:
    Create boolean (swapped) to track if an element is moved and set to false
    for each slot in data (j) as far as data.length - 1 - i:
        if data[j] is greater than data[j+1]:
            Store data[j] in variable (temp)
            Set data[j] to data[j+1]
            Set data[j+1] to temp
            Set swapped to true

    if swapped is false:
        break out of loop
