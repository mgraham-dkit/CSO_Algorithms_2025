Action: Sorts an array of elements in ascending order using selection sort
Input: Array of elements (data) to be sorted
Output: Algorithm sorts array but no value is returned

if data is null:
    Throw new Illegal Argument Exception (array to be sorted cannot be null)

if data contains one element or less:
    return nothing

for each position in array (startSlot) from 0 to length - 1:
    Create a variable (minIndex) to store index of current minimum value and set to startSlot
    for each position in array (j) from startSlot to length:
        If data[j] is less than data[minIndex]:
            Set minIndex to j

    swap data[startSlot] with data[minIndex]
